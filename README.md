   - **Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-Learn
   - **Key Features:** Data preprocessing, model training, accuracy evaluation

### 2. **Housing Price Prediction**
   - **Description:** This project uses a regression model to predict housing prices based on various features like location, square footage, and number of bedrooms.
   - **Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-Learn
   - **Key Features:** Data cleaning, feature selection, model evaluation

### 3. **Iris Dataset Classification**
   - **Description:** The Iris dataset is used to classify flowers into three species based on features like sepal length and petal width.
   - **Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib
   - **Key Features:** Classification algorithms, data visualization, model performance analysis

### 4. **Color Detection**
   - **Description:** A computer vision project that detects and classifies colors in images using OpenCV and image processing techniques.
   - **Tech Stack:** Python, OpenCV, Numpy
